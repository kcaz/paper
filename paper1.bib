RNA chemical half-lives were measured for 1036 open reading frames (ORFs) and for 329 known and predicted operons. The half-life of total mRNA was 6.8 min under the conditions tested. We also observed significant relationships between gene functional assignments and transcript stability. Unexpectedly, transcription of a single operon (tdcABCDEFG) was relatively rifampicin-insensitive and showed significant increases 2.5 min after rifampicin addition. This supports a novel mechanism of transcription for the tdc operon, whose promoter lacks any recognizable ς binding sites. Probe by probe analysis of all known and predicted operons showed that the 5′ ends of operons degrade, on average, more quickly than the rest of the transcript, with stability increasing in a 3′ direction, supporting and further generalizing the current model of a net 5′ to 3′ directionality of degradation. Hierarchical clustering analysis of operon degradation patterns revealed that this pattern predominates but is not exclusive. We found a weak but highly significant correlation between the degradation of adjacent operon regions, suggesting that stability is determined by a combination of local and operon-wide stability determinants. The 16 ORF dcw gene cluster, which has a complex promoter structure and a partially characterized degradation pattern, was studied at high resolution, allowing a detailed and integrated description of its abundance and degradation. We discuss the application of subgenic resolution DNA microarray analysis to study global mechanisms of RNA transcription and processing.},

We assess the performance of 29 gene-network-inference methods, which have been applied independently by participating teams. Performance profiling reveals that current inference methods are affected, to various degrees, by different types of systematic prediction errors. In particular, all but the best-performing method failed to accurately infer multiple regulatory inputs (combinatorial regulation) of genes. The results of this community-wide experiment show that reliable network inference from gene expression data remains an unsolved problem, and they indicate potential ways of network reconstruction improvements.},

The environment significantly influences the dynamic expression and assembly of all components encoded in the genome of an organism into functional biological networks. We have constructed a model for this process in Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 through the data-driven discovery of regulatory and functional interrelationships among ∼80\% of its genes and key abiotic factors in its hypersaline environment. Using relative changes in 72 transcription factors and 9 environmental factors (EFs) this model accurately predicts dynamic transcriptional responses of all these genes in 147 newly collected experiments representing completely novel genetic backgrounds and environments—suggesting a remarkable degree of network completeness. Using this model we have constructed and tested hypotheses critical to this organism's interaction with its changing hypersaline environment. This study supports the claim that the high degree of connectivity within biological and EF networks will enable the construction of similar models for any organism from relatively modest numbers of experiments.},

	abstract = {Annotating protein function across species is an important task that is often complicated by the presence of large paralogous gene families. Here, we report a novel strategy for identifying functionally related proteins that supplements sequence-based comparisons with information on conserved protein–protein interactions. First, the protein interaction networks of two species are aligned by assigning proteins to sequence homology clusters using the Inparanoid algorithm. Next, probabilistic inference is performed on the aligned networks to identify pairs of proteins, one from each species, that are likely to retain the same function based on conservation of their interacting partners. Applying this method to Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we analyze 121 cases for which functional orthology assignment is ambiguous when sequence similarity is used alone. In 61 of these cases, the network supports a different protein pair than that favored by sequence comparisons. These results suggest that network analysis can be used to provide a key source of information for refining sequence-based homology searches.},

Recent data suggest that heart development in Drosophila also resembles vertebrate heart development in several fundamental aspects despite the drastic morphologic differences between them. The discovery of the homeobox gene tinman, which is expressed in the embryonic heart of Drosophila and is required for heart formation, made it possible to compare the determining factors of heart development between Drosophila and vertebrates. tinman has mouse, frog, and fish relatives with considerable sequence similarity, and one of these genes is also specifically expressed in the developing heart. It appears that embryologic orgins and morphogenic movements of heart progenitors, as well as gene expression patterns and possibly their functions, are similar in Drosophila and in vertebrates. If it is true that heart development is conserved between Drosophila and vertebrates, then Drosophila, once again, could serve as a model system for vertebrate development.},

Here we address two problems involved in extending these results to the human genome: first, it has been unclear how many model organism genomes will be needed to delineate most regulatory regions; and second, the discovery of transcription-factor binding sites (response elements) from expression data has not yet been generalized from single-celled organisms to multicellular organisms. We found that 98\% (74/75) of experimentally defined sequence-specific binding sites of skeletal-muscle-specific transcription factors are confined to the 19\% of human sequences that are most conserved in the orthologous rodent sequences. Also we found that in using this restriction, the binding specificities of all three major muscle-specific transcription factors (MYF, SRF and MEF2) can be computationally identified.},

	abstract = {Although a quantitative relationship between sequence similarity and structural similarity has long been established, little is known about the impact of orthology on the relationship between protein sequence and structure. Among homologs, orthologs (derived by speciation) more frequently have similar functions than paralogs (derived by duplication). Here, we hypothesize that an orthologous pair will tend to exhibit greater structural similarity than a paralogous pair at the same level of sequence similarity. To test this hypothesis, we used 284,459 pairwise structure-based alignments of 12,634 unique domains from SCOP as well as orthology and paralogy assignments from OrthoMCL DB. We divided the comparisons by sequence identity and determined whether the sequence-structure relationship differed between the orthologs and paralogs. We found that at levels of sequence identity between 30 and 70\%, orthologous domain pairs indeed tend to be significantly more structurally similar than paralogous pairs at the same level of sequence identity. An even larger difference is found when comparing ligand binding residues instead of whole domains. These differences between orthologs and paralogs are expected to be useful for selecting template structures in comparative modeling and target proteins in structural genomics.},

A mesenchymal phenotype is the hallmark of tumour aggressiveness in human malignant glioma, but the regulatory programs responsible for implementing the associated molecular signature are largely unknown. Here we show that reverse-engineering and an unbiased interrogation of a glioma-specific regulatory network reveal the transcriptional module that activates expression of mesenchymal genes in malignant glioma. Two transcription factors (C/EBPβ and STAT3) emerge as synergistic initiators and master regulators of mesenchymal transformation. Ectopic co-expression of C/EBPβ and STAT3 reprograms neural stem cells along the aberrant mesenchymal lineage, whereas elimination of the two factors in glioma cells leads to collapse of the mesenchymal signature and reduces tumour aggressiveness. In human glioma, expression of C/EBPβ and STAT3 correlates with mesenchymal differentiation and predicts poor clinical outcome. These results show that the activation of a small regulatory module is necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain an aberrant phenotypic state in cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Measuring in a quantitative, statistical sense the degree to which structural and functional information can be “transferred” between pairs of related protein sequences at various levels of similarity is an essential prerequisite for robust genome annotation. To this end, we performed pairwise sequence, structure and function comparisons on ∼30,000 pairs of protein domains with known structure and function. Our domain pairs, which are constructed according to the SCOP fold classification, range in similarity from just sharing a fold, to being nearly identical. Our results show that traditional scores for sequence and structure similarity have the same basic exponential relationship as observed previously, with structural divergence, measured in RMS, being exponentially related to sequence divergence, measured in percent identity. However, as the scale of our survey is much larger than any previous investigations, our results have greater statistical weight and precision. We have been able to express the relationship of sequence and structure similarity using more “modern scores,“ such as Smith-Waterman alignment scores and probabilistic P-values for both sequence and structure comparison. These modern scores address some of the problems with traditional scores, such as determining a conserved core and correcting for length dependency; they enable us to phrase the sequence-structure relationship in more precise and accurate terms. We found that the basic exponential sequence-structure relationship is very general: the same essential relationship is found in the different secondary-structure classes and is evident in all the scoring schemes. To relate function to sequence and structure we assigned various levels of functional similarity to the domain pairs, based on a simple functional classification scheme. This scheme was constructed by combining and augmenting annotations in the enzyme and fly functional classifications and comparing subsets of these to the Escherichia coli and yeast classifications. We found sigmoidal relationships between similarity in function and sequence, with clear thresholds for different levels of functional conservation. For pairs of domains that share the same fold, precise function appears to be conserved down to ∼40 \% sequence identity, whereas broad functional class is conserved to ∼25 \%. Interestingly, percent identity is more effective at quantifying functional conservation than the more modern scores (e.g. P-values). Results of all the pairwise comparisons and our combined functional classification scheme for protein structures can be accessed from a web database at http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/align},

The heart network regulates genes involved in most cellular activities required for migration, including adhesion, cell polarity, and membrane protrusions. We demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor signaling and the forkhead transcription factor FoxF directly upregulate the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoDF, which synergizes with Cdc42 to contribute to the protrusive activity of migrating cells. Moreover, RhoDF induces membrane protrusions independently of other cellular activities required for migration. We propose that transcription regulation of specific effector genes determines the coordinated deployment of discrete cellular modules underlying migration.},

In the present study, we have employed both in vitro and in vivo experimental systems in the avian embryo to explore how mesoderm progenitors in the head differentiate into both heart and skeletal muscles. Using fate-mapping studies, gene expression analyses, and manipulation of signaling pathways in the chick embryo, we demonstrate that cells from the cranial paraxial mesoderm contribute to both myocardial and endocardial cell populations within the cardiac outflow tract. We further show that Bmp signaling affects the specification of mesoderm cells in the head: application of Bmp4, both in vitro and in vivo, induces cardiac differentiation in the cranial paraxial mesoderm and blocks the differentiation of skeletal muscle precursors in these cells. Our results demonstrate that cells within the cranial paraxial mesoderm play a vital role in cardiogenesis, as a new source of cardiac progenitors that populate the cardiac outflow tract in vivo. A deeper understanding of mesodermal lineage specification in the vertebrate head is expected to provide insights into the normal, as well as pathological, aspects of heart and craniofacial development.},

To test this hypothesis, we predicted networks from temporal gene expression data for 3,610 genes measured during early embryonic development in six Drosophila species and compared predicted networks to gold standard networks of ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq interactions for developmental transcription factors in five species. We found that (i) the performance of single-species networks was independent of the species where the gold standard was measured; (ii) differences between predicted networks reflected the known phylogeny and differences in biology between the species; (iii) an integrative consensus network that minimized the total number of edge gains and losses with respect to all single-species networks performed better than any individual network.

	abstract = {Motivation: The ability to jointly learn gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in, or leverage GRNs between related species would allow the vast amount of legacy data obtained in model organisms to inform the GRNs of more complex, or economically or medically relevant counterparts. Examples include transferring information from Arabidopsis thaliana into related crop species for food security purposes, or from mice into humans for medical applications. Here we develop two related Bayesian approaches to network inference that allow GRNs to be jointly inferred in, or leveraged between, several related species: in one framework, network information is directly propagated between species; in the second hierarchical approach, network information is propagated via an unobserved ‘hypernetwork’. In both frameworks, information about network similarity is captured via graph kernels, with the networks additionally informed by species-specific time series gene expression data, when available, using Gaussian processes to model the dynamics of gene expression.
Results: Results on in silico benchmarks demonstrate that joint inference, and leveraging of known networks between species, offers better accuracy than standalone inference. The direct propagation of network information via the non-hierarchical framework is more appropriate when there are relatively few species, while the hierarchical approach is better suited when there are many species. Both methods are robust to small amounts of mislabelling of orthologues. Finally, the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae data and networks to inform inference of networks in the budding yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe predicts a novel role in cell cycle regulation for Gas1 (SPAC19B12.02c), a 1,3-beta-glucanosyltransferase.

We believe that it will be more effective to use genomic data and cross-species evolutionary information from different species simultaneously, rather than to use the genomic data alone.
Results: We created a new semi-supervised learning method called Link Propagation for inferring biological networks of multiple species based on genome-wide data and evolutionary information. The new method was applied to simultaneous reconstruction of three metabolic networks of Caenorhabditis elegans, Helicobacter pylori and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, based on gene expression similarities and amino acid sequence similarities. The experimental results proved that the new simultaneous network inference method consistently improves the predictive performance over the individual network inferences, and it also outperforms in accuracy and speed other established methods such as the pairwise support vector machine.

Results: We present an algorithm merging microarray datasets on the basis of co-expression alone, without any requirement for orthology information to affiliate genes. Combining existing methods such as co-inertia analysis, back-transformation, Hungarian matching and majority voting in an iterative non-greedy hill-climbing approach, it affiliates arrays and genes at the same time, maximizing the co-structure between the datasets. To introduce the method, we demonstrate its performance on two closely and two distantly related datasets of different experimental context and produced on different platforms. Each pair stems from two different species. The resulting cross-species dynamic Bayesian gene networks improve on the networks inferred from each dataset alone by yielding more significant network motifs, as well as more of the interactions already recorded in KEGG and other databases. Also, it is shown that our algorithm converges on the optimal number of nodes for network inference. Being readily extendable to more than two datasets, it provides the opportunity to infer extensive gene regulatory networks.

Th17 cells have critical roles in mucosal defense and are major contributors to inflammatory disease. Their differentiation requires the nuclear hormone receptor RORγt working with multiple other essential transcription factors (TFs). We have used an iterative systems approach, combining genome-wide TF occupancy, expression profiling of TF mutants, and expression time series to delineate the Th17 global transcriptional regulatory network. We find that cooperatively bound BATF and IRF4 contribute to initial chromatin accessibility and, with STAT3, initiate a transcriptional program that is then globally tuned by the lineage-specifying TF RORγt, which plays a focal deterministic role at key loci. Integration of multiple data sets allowed inference of an accurate predictive model that we computationally and experimentally validated, identifying multiple new Th17 regulators, including Fosl2, a key determinant of cellular plasticity. This interconnected network can be used to investigate new therapeutic approaches to manipulate Th17 functions in the setting of inflammatory disease.},

	abstract = {Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and their networks play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes and their comparative analysis, complete descriptions of interactomes and their comparative analysis is fundamental to a deeper understanding of biological processes. A first step in such an analysis is to align two or more PPI networks. Here, we introduce an algorithm, IsoRank, for global alignment of multiple PPI networks. The guiding intuition here is that a protein in one PPI network is a good match for a protein in another network if their respective sequences and neighborhood topologies are a good match. We encode this intuition as an eigenvalue problem in a manner analogous to Google's PageRank method. Using IsoRank, we compute a global alignment of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens PPI networks. We demonstrate that incorporating PPI data in ortholog prediction results in improvements over existing sequence-only approaches and over predictions from local alignments of the yeast and fly networks. Previous methods have been effective at identifying conserved, localized network patterns across pairs of networks. This work takes the further step of performing a global alignment of multiple PPI networks. It simultaneously uses sequence similarity and network data and, unlike previous approaches, explicitly models the tradeoff inherent in combining them. We expect IsoRank—with its simultaneous handling of node similarity and network similarity—to be applicable across many scientific domains.},

Althoughtwistis expressed in precursors of adult muscles throughout the larval and early pupal stages, we demonstrate that Twist function is required only during the late larval stage for DLM patterning. In wild-type flies, this is just prior to the time when three pairs of persistent larval muscle fibers split longitudinally to form templates for the six pairs of DLMs. By examining sections at various times during pupal development, we found that splitting of the larval muscles does not occur intwistmutants, indicating that Twist function is required to induce major changes in the larval templates prior to differentiation. The function of Twist in larval muscle splitting is likely mediated by myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) since inMef2hypomorphic mutants splitting is also reduced andMef2expression is dependent upon Twist. Our findings define specific roles for Twist and MEF2 during pupal myogenesis and demonstrate that these transcription factors function in adult muscle precursor cells to regulate downstream factors controlling muscle cell splitting and morphogenesis.},

The environment significantly influences the dynamic expression and assembly of all components encoded in the genome of an organism into functional biological networks. We have constructed a model for this process in Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 through the data-driven discovery of regulatory and functional interrelationships among ∼80\% of its genes and key abiotic factors in its hypersaline environment. Using relative changes in 72 transcription factors and 9 environmental factors (EFs) this model accurately predicts dynamic transcriptional responses of all these genes in 147 newly collected experiments representing completely novel genetic backgrounds and environments—suggesting a remarkable degree of network completeness. Using this model we have constructed and tested hypotheses critical to this organism's interaction with its changing hypersaline environment. This study supports the claim that the high degree of connectivity within biological and EF networks will enable the construction of similar models for any organism from relatively modest numbers of experiments.},

	abstract = {Numerous methods have been developed for inferring gene regulatory networks from expression data, however, both their absolute and comparative performance remain poorly understood. In this paper, we introduce a framework for critical performance assessment of methods for gene network inference. We present an in silico benchmark suite that we provided as a blinded, community-wide challenge within the context of the DREAM (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) project. We assess the performance of 29 gene-network-inference methods, which have been applied independently by participating teams. Performance profiling reveals that current inference methods are affected, to various degrees, by different types of systematic prediction errors. In particular, all but the best-performing method failed to accurately infer multiple regulatory inputs (combinatorial regulation) of genes. The results of this community-wide experiment show that reliable network inference from gene expression data remains an unsolved problem, and they indicate potential ways of network reconstruction improvements.},
