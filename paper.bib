@article{stromeyer_low_1982,
	Abstract = {Previous work showed that adapting to low spatial frequency gratings (below 1.5 cycles/degree) may cause maximal spatial adaptation at a significantly higher spatial frequency. It has been suggested that there are no adaptable spatial-frequency channels tuned to below 1.5 c/deg. Contrary to this view, we found that adaptation and masking with low spatial frequencies (0.12-1.0 c/deg) produced maximal threshold elevations when the test patterns were the same spatial frequency as the adapting or masking pattern. These results were obtained using test patterns that turned on and off gradually or sharply. The results suggest that there are form mechanisms optimally sensitive to very low spatial frequencies. Adaptation was selective to position (phase) and orientation at low spatial frequencies; masking was observed to be selective to orientation at a spatial frequency as low as 0.2 c/deg. A clear dichotomy between transient, motion channels and sustained, form channels at low spatial and temporal frequencies may represent an unrealistic simplification. There may exist directionally-selective motion mechanisms sensitive to very slow motion, and these may play a role in the discrimination of form. The discussion considers the bandwidths of the low spatial frequency mechanisms.},

Regan and Beverly 1985 showed improvement in ori discr after adaptation. They can't account for it
Muller et al 1999 found sharpening near adapter. For monkey complex cells. They adapted very briefly
What does our model say?
Some discussion of synaptic mechanisms of plasticity. speculation about the relationship between adaptation and learning. maybe a bit weak.

@article{dragoi_foci_2001,
	Abstract = {Cortical areas are generally assumed to be uniform in their capacity for adaptive changes or plasticity. Here we demonstrate, however, that neurons in the cat striate cortex (V1) show pronounced adaptation-induced short-term plasticity of orientation tuning primarily at specific foci. V1 neurons are clustered according to their orientation preference in iso-orientation domains that converge at singularities or pinwheel centres. Although neurons in pinwheel centres have similar orientation tuning and responses to those in iso-orientation domains, we find that they differ markedly in their capacity for adaptive changes. Adaptation with an oriented drifting grating stimulus alters responses of neurons located at and near pinwheel centres to a broad range of orientations, causing repulsive shifts in orientation preference and changes in response magnitude. In contrast, neurons located in iso-orientation domains show minimal changes in their tuning properties after adaptation. The anisotropy of adaptation-induced orientation plasticity is probably mediated by inhomogeneities in local intracortical interactions that are overlaid on the map of orientation preference in V1.},
	Annote = {Adaptation produces repulsion mainly near orientation pinwheels. This suggests that adaptation effects are due to recurrent excitation or inhibition. They point out that far tuning curve enhancement can only be disinhibition.

@article{dragoi_dynamic_2000,
	Abstract = {A fundamental feature of neural circuitry in the primary visual cortex (V1) is the existence of recurrent excitatory connections between spiny neurons, recurrent inhibitory connections between smooth neurons, and local connections between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We modeled the dynamic behavior of intermixed excitatory and inhibitory populations of cells in V1 that receive input from the classical receptive field (the receptive field center) through feedforward thalamocortical afferents, as well as input from outside the classical receptive field (the receptive field surround) via long-range intracortical connections. A counterintuitive result is that the response of oriented cells can be facilitated beyond optimal levels when the surround stimulus is cross-oriented with respect to the center and suppressed when the surround stimulus is iso-oriented. This effect is primarily due to changes in recurrent inhibition within a local circuit. Cross-oriented surround stimulation leads to a reduction of presynaptic inhibition and a supraoptimal response, whereas iso-oriented surround stimulation has the opposite effect. This mechanism is used to explain the orientation and contrast dependence of contextual interactions in primary visual cortex: responses to a center stimulus can be both strongly suppressed and supraoptimally facilitated as a function of surround orientation, and these effects diminish as stimulus contrast decreases.},

	Abstract = {A key emergent property of the primary visual cortex (V1) is the orientation selectivity of its neurons. The extent to which adult visual cortical neurons can exhibit changes in orientation selectivity is unknown. Here we use single-unit recording and intrinsic signal imaging in V1 of adult cats to demonstrate systematic repulsive shifts in orientation preference following short-term exposure (adaptation) to one stimulus orientation. In contrast to the common view of adaptation as a passive process by which responses around the adapting orientation are reduced, we show that changes in orientation tuning also occur due to response increases at orientations away from the adapting stimulus. Adaptation-induced orientation plasticity is thus an active time-dependent process that involves network interactions and includes both response depression and enhancement.},

@article{carandini_adaptation_1997,
	Abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) adapt selectively to contingencies in the attributes of visual stimuli. We recorded from single neurons in macaque V1 and measured the effects of adaptation either to the sum of two gratings (compound stimulus) or to the individual gratings. According to our hypothesis, there would be a component of adaptation that is specific to the compound stimulus. In a first series of experiments, the two gratings differed in orientation. One grating had optimal orientation and the other was orthogonal to it, and therefore did not activate the neuron under study. These experiments provided evidence in favour of our hypothesis. In most cells adaptation to the compound stimulus reduced responses to the compound stimulus more than it reduced responses to the optimal grating, and the responses to the compound stimulus were reduced more by adaptation to the compound stimulus than by adaptation to the individual gratings. This suggests that a component of adaptation was specific to (and caused by) the simultaneous presence of the two orientations in the compound stimulus. To test whether V1 neurons could adapt to other contingencies in the stimulus attributes, we performed a second series of experiments, in which the component gratings were parallel but differed in spatial frequency, and were both effective in activating the neuron under study. These experiments failed to reveal convincing contingent effects of adaptation, suggesting that neurons cannot adapt equally well to all types of contingency.},

@article{smirnakis_adaptation_1997,
	Abstract = {Owing to the limited dynamic range of a neuron's output, neural circuits are faced with a trade-off between encoding the full range of their inputs and resolving gradations among those inputs. For example, the ambient light level varies daily over more than nine orders of magnitude, whereas the firing rate of optic nerve fibres spans less than two. This discrepancy is alleviated by light adaptation: as the mean intensity increases, the retina becomes proportionately less sensitive. However, image statistics other than the mean intensity also vary drastically during routine visual processing. Theory predicts that an efficient visual encoder should adapt its strategy not only to the mean, but to the full shape of the intensity distribution. Here we report that retinal ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina, adapt to both image contrast-the range of light intensities-and to spatial correlations within the scene, even at constant mean intensity. The adaptation occurs on a scale of seconds, one hundred times more slowly than the immediate light response, and involves 2-5-fold changes in the firing rate. It is mediated within the retinal network: two independent sites of modulation after the photoreceptor cells appear to be involved. Our results demonstrate a remarkable plasticity in retinal processing that may contribute to the contrast adaptation of human vision.},

@article{regan_postadaptation_1985,
	Abstract = {An orientational difference of only 0.3-0.5 deg can be discriminated between two gratings or two lines, although psychophysical channels and cortical cells both have comparatively broad orientation bandwidths of 10-25 deg. One proposed explanation for the fineness of orientation discrimination is that, while detection is determined by the most excited orientation-tuned neural elements, superthreshold orientation discrimination is determined by difference signals between these elements [Westheimer et al., J. Opt. Soc. Am. 66, 332 (1976)]. This implies that, if stimulus orientation is changed slightly, the most important elements for discriminating this change will be those whose relative activity changes most, even though the excitation of these elements may be comparatively weak. In accord with this prediction, we found that adapting to a high-contrast grating degraded discrimination for test gratings inclined at about 10-20 deg to the adapting grating while having little effect on the detection of these inclined gratings. For test gratings parallel to the adapting grating, discrimination was improved, but detection was degraded. Either an opponent-process or a line-element model can account for these effects of adaptation. An opponent model can also explain our findings that subjects do not confound orientation change with contrast change and that suprathreshold orientation discrimination is almost independent of contrast, varying by only +/- 10\% from about 3 to about 25 times contrast threshold. A discrimination model must incorporate reliable storage of spatial frequency, because discrimination was not affected by increasing the interval between grating presentations from 1 to 10 sec.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 250 {WORDS})},

	Abstract = {1. Inspection of a high-contrast adapting grating produces two visual after-effects: (a) the contrast threshold is raised for test gratings of similar spatial frequency to that of the adapting pattern and (b) the apparent spatial frequency of test gratings shifts away from that of the adapting grating-higher frequencies seem higher and lower ones lower than they really are.2. Both after-effects are orientation-specific. A horizontal adapting grating influences neither the threshold nor the apparent spatial frequency of vertical test gratings.3. The magnitude of the two after-effects was measured with vertical test gratings as a function of (a) tilt of a high-contrast adapting grating and (b) contrast of a vertical adapting grating.4. At all frequencies of the test grating, the decline of both after-effects produced by an increase in tilt of approximately 6(3/4) degrees could be matched by a reduction in contrast by a factor of 2.5. We take this as evidence for a common neural origin for these two visual phenomena.},
